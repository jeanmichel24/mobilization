      <p>The mobilisation in 2022, which Russian authorities called "partial" will be remembered by Russian residents for a long time. This was immediately followed by raids and extensive roundups of people: men were stopped at the underground stations and handed summonses, they were anticipated at the building entrances in the morning, and in some cases they came straight home and were taken to the military registration and enlistment office.

      The announcement of mobilisation led not only to emigration — with at least 200 thousand people leaving in the first week after September 21 — but also mass protests in various cities. OVD-Info recalls and analyzes how those who opposed mobilisation and war were persecuted.

    <em>"The recent mobilization not only sparked protests and dissatisfaction regarding the draft itself but also ignited another wave of actions against the extensive invasion of Ukraine. People openly expressed their opposition to both the war and the government's directive to join the front lines.We learned that between September 21 and October 10, 2022, there were as many as 2,457 arrests made by security forces. In terms of who's getting detained at these anti-mobilization protests, it turns out that we know the gender of about 84% of them. Interestingly, 56% of these individuals are women, that's 1,162 of them, while 44% are men, totaling 908. This really highlights the substantial role women are playing in these anti-war protests. Moreover, we've got age data for 59% of all those detained, and it shows that the majority, in 1,079 instances, are young people aged between 18 to 35"</em>, said Igor Lantrapov, the OVD Info representative.

      <p>Long-standing systematic repression helped the security forces suppress the September surge of anti-war protests. However, these same practices contributed to the development of protests in the form of direct actions — arson attacks on military recruitment centres and damage to railway equipment. The authorities responded by increasing sentences for such actions (including classifying them as terrorist acts) and tightening legislation on «sabotage.»

<p>Mobilisation has also contributed to unifying people and civil society: new projects and initiatives have emerged to help people leave and avoid mobilisation, such as <a href="https://t.me/iditelesom_help">»Go to the forest»</a> and the social media bot <a href="https://t.me/ne_poedu_bot">»I will not go»</a>. Organisations that tell people why they should not take a summons and go to the military enlistment office have become even more relevant and more in demand — among them are <a href="https://peaceplea.org/">»Appeal to Conscience»</a>, <a href="https://netprizyvu.ru/">»Conscript School»</a> and <a href="https://ksmrus.ru/">»Committee of Soldiers' Mothers»</a>. From this, we can conclude that each wave of increased state violence brings a new wave of solidarity.</p>
